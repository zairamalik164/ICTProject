        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Mental health is vital for over-all well-being, influencing how we think, feel and act in daily life. It affects relationships, decision-making and how we handle stress. Prioritizing mental health fosters resilience, productivity and a balanced life. Just as physical health requires care, mental health needs attention through self-care, seeking help when needed and reducing stigma around mental illness. A healthy mind ensures a healthier, happier life. </p>
